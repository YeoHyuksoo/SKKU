        If I have most respecting person, he is Son. I loved him when he is in Hamburg SV, and have seen
        fantastic growth of him. He arrived on top class in the soccer world with just great passion.
        I want to jump into something with such passion and enjoy the highest honor like him.
        He has continuously made a goal with his best foam and movement in the Tottenham Hotspur.

        I have a part-time job now. It's convenient store staff.
        It's been about 3 months.
        I thought of studying while earning money to relieve my parents' troubles a little.
        But I regret it a little. It's not easy to concentrate on both staff task & student task.
        Also wearing a mask during staff work is bad.
