	I make a 2-dimensional array to input values of path matrices.
And I have a arrays that have a x,y points of accessed points of matrices.
First, I put the data from file into maze 2-dimensional array.
Next, find the location of starting point and end point.
Accessing adjacent points of the starting point in order of down, right, right , up, and write the length into the point.
If any one of points is satisfied above, We should write index into the point.
Moreover, we should act again like above(starting point gonna be index1 points).
We repeated this action until the end point changes to some particular number.
If we do this for m*n times but we can't change the end point, print NULL to output text file.
If not, we found end point, so we should start traceback.
First, final length is end point.
Next, we find whether the length-1 number is existed in near the end point.
If we can find, that point is next length.
If we can't find, that point is supposed to be a warp zone, so the warp which we first accessed is the next length.
If we do this act repeatly, we can finally find start point.
We can finish to write data of length points into the output file.
