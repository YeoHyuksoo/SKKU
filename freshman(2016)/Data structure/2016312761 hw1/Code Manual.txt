Code Manual 2016312761 Yeo Hyuk soo

I made some 2-dimensional array whose range is 1000*1000.
And out limit of the number of input is 10000, so I made other
array variables that contain a x-coordinate, y-coordinate and number value.
And first, we open a kind of input file.
We should get some values from file such as choice, which do you want to
run(r or c), the size of matrix(x-axis and y-axis), and the numbers
goes to each coordinates of matrix.
We should close the file, now.
Then, we can have two case, whether choice is r or c.
Both r or c, we should do two action, and one action must read matrix widthwise
, another action must read matrix lengethwise.
Then, we read numbers only that is not zero whether widthwise way or lengethwise way. 
Any actions, these values are x-coordinate, y-coordinate, and numbers.
But their sequences are little bit different,
 so I omit the explanation of various sequences.
And we should print some values in another output files.
Lastly, close the files, and we can get ultimate results in the files.
